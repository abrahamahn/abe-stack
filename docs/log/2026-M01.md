# January 2026

> **Monthly Summary (Audited)**: January established the platform baseline and then accelerated into architecture hardening, security uplift, package decoupling, and deployment readiness.

## Audit Scope

This monthly report is derived from:

- [2026-W01](./2026-W01.md)
- [2026-W02](./2026-W02.md)
- [2026-W03](./2026-W03.md)
- [2026-W04](./2026-W04.md)

## Week-by-Week Findings

### W01 (Dec 29-Jan 4): Foundation + UI Systemization

- Built and organized the first full UI system (`components`, `elements`, `layouts`, `hooks`, `theme`, `utils`).
- Completed auth foundation with JWT access + refresh token flow and provider wiring.
- Standardized package naming/releases (`@abe-stack/shared`, `@abe-stack/client-engine`) and secondary exports.
- Established testing baseline with **724 shared/ui tests** and accessibility/keyboard coverage.
- Set documentation and operating conventions (`AGENTS.md`, development workflow docs, quality gates).

### W02 (Jan 6-12): Server Architecture + Security Baseline

- Adopted **ServerEnvironment context object** pattern for explicit dependencies and testability.
- Introduced hybrid structure separating infra and business modules.
- Added typed HTTP error hierarchy (`ValidationError`, `UnauthorizedError`, `RateLimitError`, etc.) and utilities.
- Hardened auth/security flows: transactions, token reuse event logging, trusted proxy IP extraction, admin unlock endpoint.
- Reorganized docs architecture and cleaned strict TypeScript issues.

### W03 (Jan 13-19): Production Features + Enterprise Security

- Implemented complete pagination stack (cursor + offset), designed for larger-scale usage.
- Upgraded security posture with CSP nonce strategy, encrypted CSRF tokens, role-based rate limits, and isolation headers.
- Added SDK-side infra patterns (request/cache/subscription utilities, undo/redo patterns).
- Consolidated tooling and build consistency (project refs, cache/build improvements, export/lint cleanup).
- Continued auth and reliability fixes (including email send path stability).

### W04 (Jan 20-25): Decoupling + Deployment Readiness + Product Expansion

- Executed major dependency reductions and custom replacements (state/router/query/validation paths).
- Delivered OAuth + Magic Link auth, plus broad hardening and architectural decoupling between server/client layers.
- Built deployment/IaC and pipeline foundation (Terraform, CI/CD workflow direction, deployment pack/docs).
- Added major product surfaces: SaaS billing (Stripe + PayPal), admin command center, profile/settings UX.
- Closed large quality backlog (70+ lint/type fixes) with very high test volume reporting (7k+ tests passing).

## Consolidated Monthly Outcomes

- **Platform maturity jump**: from base scaffold to structured, testable, and modular architecture.
- **Security maturity jump**: from baseline controls to deeper auth/rate-limit/CSRF/proxy hardening patterns.
- **Product maturity jump**: major business surfaces (billing/admin/settings/auth variants) became first-class.
- **Delivery maturity jump**: deployment and CI/CD pathways became actively integrated into day-to-day flow.
