# February 2026

> **Monthly Summary (Audited, In Progress)**: February centered on monorepo convergence and delivery reliability, then shifted to CI/CD hardening and fast recovery from lint/test pipeline failures.

## Audit Scope

This monthly report is derived from:

- [2026-W06](./2026-W06.md)
- [2026-W07](./2026-W07.md)

## Week-by-Week Findings

### W06 (Feb 2-8): Monorepo Convergence + Deep Audits

- Completed major structure convergence to unified `src/` hierarchy and package consolidation.
- Advanced `@abe-stack/db` heavily: repository refactors, schema/test expansion, package layout cleanup.
- Performed large `@abe-stack/shared` cleanup and security work (manual schema direction, barrel export cleanup, multi-round audits).
- Refactored and audited `@abe-stack/server-engine` and `@abe-stack/media` with focused security/performance fixes.
- Standardized naming/schema consistency and removed broad quality debt across packages/tools.

### W07 (Feb 9-15, current): CI/CD and Pipeline Stabilization

- Simplified and corrected workflow behavior around deploy/infra-test sequencing.
- Fixed invalid infra-test workflow expressions and provider gating issues.
- Reconciled no-Husky local hooks strategy with robust pre-push quality gates.
- Diagnosed and fixed CI/runtime quality failures:
  - missing/invalid action tags
  - broken header-sync command usage in CI
  - TypeScript path resolution issues causing lint cascades
  - Vitest workspace alias/package entry resolution failures
- Revalidated local quality gates with successful full runs of `pnpm test` and `pnpm lint`.

## Consolidated Monthly Outcomes (To Date)

- **Structural stability**: core repository layout and package boundaries are more consistent and maintainable.
- **Pipeline stability**: push-to-CI and CI-to-deploy flow has fewer invalid branches and clearer failure surfaces.
- **Quality stability**: recent lint/test failures were converted into deterministic fixes and verification loops.
- **Delivery readiness**: DigitalOcean-focused deployment automation is materially closer to predictable operation.
