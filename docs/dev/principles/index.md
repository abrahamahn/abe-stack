# ABE Stack - Coding Principles & Technical Vision

This file is a short index. Use the modules below for fast checks or full rationale.

Quick Summary:

- DRY and separation of concerns are non-negotiable.
- Keep business logic framework-agnostic in `packages/core`.
- Use TDD: failing tests drive fixes, not the other way around.
- New files must start with a path header comment.
- Optimize for developer velocity without sacrificing correctness.

## Modules

- `./principles-core.md` → The core rules, short form.
- `./principles-why.md` → Rationale and trade-offs.
