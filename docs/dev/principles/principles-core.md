# Principles Core

Quick reference for the ABE Stack principles. Use this for fast checks before deeper rationale.

## Vision

ABE Stack is a production-ready, developer-velocity-first monorepo that teams can understand quickly and ship without surprises.

## Core Values

1. Velocity over perfection
2. Simplicity over cleverness
3. Type safety over runtime checks
4. Framework-agnostic core
5. Lean but complete

## Principles Summary (1-18)

1. DRY: one source of truth, no duplication
2. Separation of concerns across layers
3. React as renderer only
4. Framework-agnostic core in shared
5. Minimal dependencies
6. Type safety everywhere
7. Test business logic, not React
8. Documentation as code
9. Quality gates are mandatory
10. Production-ready defaults
11. Respect monorepo boundaries
12. Colocate related code
13. Prefer explicit over implicit
14. Security by default
15. Optimize for developer experience first
16. Comments explain why, code explains what
17. Decisions must be documented
18. Security and privacy principles (data handling, validation)
