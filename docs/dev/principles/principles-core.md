# Principles Core

Quick reference for the ABE Stack principles. Use this for fast checks before deeper rationale.

## Vision

ABE Stack is a production-ready, developer-velocity-first monorepo that teams can understand quickly and ship without surprises.

## Core Values

1. Velocity over perfection
2. Simplicity over cleverness
3. Type safety over runtime checks
4. Framework-agnostic core
5. Lean but complete

## Principles Summary (1-18)

1. DRY: one source of truth, no duplication
2. Separation of concerns across layers
3. React as renderer only
4. Framework-agnostic core in shared
5. Minimal dependencies
6. Type safety everywhere
7. TDD: write failing tests for real usage and edge cases, then fix code
8. Documentation as code
9. New files start with a path header comment
10. Quality gates are mandatory
11. Production-ready defaults
12. Respect monorepo boundaries
13. Colocate related code
14. Prefer explicit over implicit
15. Security by default
16. Optimize for developer experience first
17. Comments explain why, code explains what
18. Decisions must be documented
19. Security and privacy principles (data handling, validation)
