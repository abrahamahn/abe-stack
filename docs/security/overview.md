# üîí Security Overview

## üìã Introduction

Security is a fundamental aspect of the ABE Stack architecture. This document provides an overview of the security principles, measures, and best practices implemented throughout the application to protect data and ensure system integrity.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Principles

The ABE Stack follows these core security principles:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Components only have access to what they need
- **Secure by Default**: Security built into default configurations
- **Zero Trust**: Verify all requests regardless of source
- **Security as Code**: Security practices integrated into the development process
- **Data Protection**: Comprehensive protection of sensitive information
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing surveillance of system security

## üèóÔ∏è Security Architecture

The ABE Stack implements a multi-layered security architecture:

### 1. Infrastructure Security Layer

- **Network Security**: Firewalls, security groups, and traffic filtering
- **Infrastructure Hardening**: Secure configuration of servers and containers
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular scanning and patching of infrastructure
- **Access Control**: Strict control over infrastructure access
- **Log Management**: Centralized infrastructure logging for security monitoring

### 2. Application Security Layer

- **Authentication**: Secure identity verification of users and services
- **Authorization**: Granular permission system for access control
- **Input Validation**: Thorough validation of all input data
- **Output Encoding**: Prevention of injection attacks through proper encoding
- **Session Management**: Secure handling of user sessions
- **API Security**: Protection of API endpoints with authentication and rate limiting

### 3. Data Security Layer

- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted in the database
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS for all communications
- **Data Classification**: Categorization of data based on sensitivity
- **Data Masking**: Obscuring sensitive data in logs and non-production environments
- **Data Retention**: Policies for secure data retention and deletion

## üîê Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication

The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication with the following features:

- **Secure Token Generation**: Industry-standard practices for token creation
- **Short-lived Access Tokens**: Typical validity period of 15 minutes
- **Refresh Token Rotation**: Single-use refresh tokens with longer validity
- **Token Revocation**: Ability to invalidate tokens when needed
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Optional second factor for authentication

### Authorization

Authorization is implemented using role-based access control (RBAC):

- **Roles**: Predefined sets of permissions (e.g., Admin, User, Editor)
- **Permissions**: Fine-grained access controls for specific actions
- **Resource-based Access**: Permissions tied to specific resources
- **Attribute-based Rules**: Dynamic authorization based on user attributes
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: For complex permission scenarios

## üõë Common Attack Protections

The ABE Stack implements protection against common web application vulnerabilities:

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Automatic output encoding in templates
- Input sanitization
- XSS-focused security testing

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- Anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Same-site cookies
- Origin verification

### SQL Injection

- Parameterized queries
- ORM with prepared statements
- Input validation
- Limited database privileges

### Authentication Attacks

- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Account lockout policies
- Password complexity requirements
- Secure password storage with bcrypt/Argon2

### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

- Allowlist for permitted URLs and domains
- Restricted network access from application servers
- URL validation and sanitization

## üìä Logging and Monitoring

Security-focused logging and monitoring includes:

- **Security Event Logging**: All security-relevant events are logged
- **Centralized Log Management**: Logs collected and analyzed centrally
- **Log Integrity**: Protection against tampering with logs
- **Real-time Alerting**: Immediate notification of suspicious activities
- **Security Dashboard**: Visual monitoring of security metrics
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of unusual patterns in system behavior

## üîç Audit and Compliance

The application supports auditing and compliance requirements through:

- **User Activity Auditing**: Tracking of user actions
- **Change Tracking**: Versioning of data changes
- **Compliance Reports**: Automated generation of compliance reports
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Features to support GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations
- **External Audit Support**: Facilitating third-party security audits

## üß™ Security Testing

The security testing strategy includes:

- **Automated Security Testing**: Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Code analysis for vulnerabilities
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Runtime vulnerability scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Checking third-party libraries for vulnerabilities
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular manual testing by security experts
- **Bug Bounty Program**: Incentives for reporting security issues

## üö® Incident Response

The security incident response process includes:

1. **Preparation**: Documentation, tools, and procedures
2. **Detection**: Monitoring systems to identify incidents
3. **Analysis**: Determining the scope and impact
4. **Containment**: Limiting the damage
5. **Eradication**: Removing the threat
6. **Recovery**: Restoring systems to normal
7. **Post-incident Review**: Learning from incidents

## üìù Security Development Lifecycle

Security is integrated throughout the development process:

- **Design Phase**: Threat modeling and security requirements
- **Development Phase**: Secure coding practices and developer training
- **Testing Phase**: Security testing and vulnerability assessment
- **Deployment Phase**: Secure configuration and hardening
- **Maintenance Phase**: Security updates and monitoring

## üß∞ Security Tools and Libraries

The ABE Stack uses these key security tools and libraries:

- **Authentication**: Passport.js, JWT libraries
- **Encryption**: Node.js crypto, bcrypt/Argon2
- **Input Validation**: Zod, Express validator
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Snyk, OWASP ZAP
- **Dependency Checking**: npm audit, Dependabot
- **Monitoring**: ELK Stack, Prometheus + Grafana

## üìö Security Best Practices for Developers

Developers should follow these security best practices:

1. **Never Trust Input**: Validate all input data
2. **Use Parameterized Queries**: Prevent SQL injection
3. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Both at rest and in transit
4. **Implement Proper Authentication**: Follow authentication best practices
5. **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege**: Limit access to only what's needed
6. **Use Security Headers**: Implement HTTP security headers
7. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update third-party libraries
8. **Avoid Security by Obscurity**: Don't rely on hiding vulnerabilities
9. **Follow Secure Coding Guidelines**: Adhere to established secure coding practices
10. **Conduct Security Reviews**: Regular code and security reviews
