# 🏗️ Architecture Overview

## 📋 Introduction

The ABE Stack is a modern, scalable application framework built with TypeScript that follows clean architecture principles. This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, design philosophy, and key components.

## 🔍 Design Philosophy

Our architecture is guided by the following principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different parts of the application
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Business logic organized around domain concepts
- **Modularity**: Independently deployable and testable components
- **Testability**: Design that facilitates automated testing at all levels
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load through horizontal scaling
- **Maintainability**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend the codebase

## 🏛️ Architectural Style

The ABE Stack implements a layered, modular architecture combining aspects of:

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation into domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Core business logic isolated from external concerns
- **Microservices-Ready**: Components designed for potential extraction into microservices

## 📦 System Components

The system consists of the following major components:

### Frontend Layer

- **Client Application**: React-based single-page application
- **State Management**: Redux for global state management
- **API Integration**: Axios-based service layer for backend communication
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components with consistent design

### Backend Layer

- **API Layer**: Express.js REST API endpoints
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and orchestration
- **Domain Layer**: Core business entities and rules
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External communication, persistence, and cross-cutting concerns

### Infrastructure Components

- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **Cache**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication and authorization
- **Messaging**: Event-based communication between services
- **Logging**: Structured logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Job Processing**: Background task processing

## 🔄 Request Flow

A typical request flows through the system as follows:

1. Client sends a request to the backend API
2. API layer validates request and authentication
3. Request is routed to the appropriate service
4. Service orchestrates domain operations
5. Domain logic is executed with infrastructure support
6. Results are returned through the service to the API
7. API formats the response and sends it to the client

## 📊 Data Flow

Data flows through the system following these patterns:

- **Command Flow**: User actions trigger commands that modify the system state
- **Query Flow**: User requests for data are processed through optimized query paths
- **Event Flow**: System changes emit events that can trigger additional processing

## 🧩 Dependency Management

We use dependency injection to manage component dependencies, which:

- Makes testing easier through mock implementations
- Provides flexibility to replace implementations
- Creates a clear picture of component dependencies
- Supports the dependency inversion principle

## 🔄 Modularity and Extension

The system is designed for modularity through:

- **Feature Modules**: Business functionality grouped by domain area
- **Plugin Architecture**: Infrastructure components are pluggable
- **Extension Points**: Well-defined interfaces for adding new functionality
- **Configuration-Based Behavior**: Adjustable system behavior without code changes

## 💾 Persistence Strategy

Our data persistence approach includes:

- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access behind interfaces
- **ORM**: TypeORM for database operations
- **Migration Support**: Versioned database schema changes
- **Caching Layer**: Performance optimization for frequently accessed data

## 🔒 Security Architecture

Security is built into the architecture through:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation at API boundaries
- **Data Protection**: Encryption for sensitive data
- **CSRF Protection**: Measures against cross-site request forgery

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

The architecture supports scalability through:

- **Stateless Design**: No server-side session state
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple instances behind a load balancer
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and sharding support
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching to reduce database load
- **Background Processing**: Offloading intensive tasks to worker processes

## 🔄 Deployment Architecture

The system supports various deployment models:

- **Monolithic Deployment**: Single application deployment
- **Service-Based Deployment**: Separate deployments for major components
- **Containerization**: Docker-based deployment
- **Cloud-Native**: Support for cloud platform services
