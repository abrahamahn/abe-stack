# ADR-0001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2023-10-15

## Context

As we begin development of the ABE Stack project, we need to select the core technology stack that will be used for both frontend and backend development. This decision will have significant implications for development speed, maintainability, scalability, and the skills required from the team.

We need a stack that:

- Provides strong typing and compile-time safety
- Has robust ecosystem support and mature libraries
- Enables high developer productivity
- Supports modern architectural patterns
- Scales well for enterprise applications
- Has good documentation and community support
- Can be efficiently deployed to various environments

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the following technology stack:

### Core Technologies

- **Language**: TypeScript for both frontend and backend
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub as the repository host
- **Package Management**: npm/yarn

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React 18+
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **UI Components**: Material-UI (MUI)
- **API Communication**: Axios
- **Build Tools**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E

### Backend

- **Runtime**: Node.js (LTS version)
- **API Framework**: Express.js
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Database ORM**: TypeORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Testing**: Vitest, Supertest
- **Logging**: Pino

### DevOps & Infrastructure

- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose (development), Kubernetes (production)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## Rationale

### TypeScript

TypeScript was selected for the following reasons:

- Provides strong typing which catches errors at compile time
- Enhances developer experience through better tooling and IDE support
- Improves code maintainability and refactorability
- Same language on frontend and backend reduces context switching
- Growing industry adoption and vibrant ecosystem

### React

React was chosen as the frontend framework because:

- Mature ecosystem with robust tooling
- Component-based architecture aligns with our design philosophy
- Large developer community and extensive learning resources
- Good performance characteristics
- Flexible enough to adapt to changing requirements

### Express.js

Express was selected for the backend framework because:

- Lightweight and flexible
- Well-established with extensive documentation
- Large ecosystem of middleware
- Performance characteristics suitable for our needs
- Team has existing expertise

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL was chosen as the primary database because:

- ACID compliance for reliable transactions
- Rich feature set including JSON support
- Excellent performance and scalability characteristics
- Strong data integrity guarantees
- Open source with commercial support options available

### TypeORM

TypeORM was selected as our ORM because:

- Works well with TypeScript
- Supports multiple database systems
- Provides a flexible query builder
- Supports migrations
- Active development and community support

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Using TypeScript will improve code quality and maintainability
- Shared language between frontend and backend simplifies knowledge sharing
- Mature ecosystem provides tested solutions for common problems
- The selected technologies have good interoperability
- Strong typing will facilitate future refactoring
- Selected technologies have good documentation and community support

### Negative Consequences

- TypeScript adds compilation overhead and initial development setup complexity
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with TypeScript
- More verbose code compared to vanilla JavaScript
- Slightly higher build and deployment complexity
- TypeORM has some limitations with complex database operations

### Mitigations

- Provide onboarding materials and training for TypeScript
- Create streamlined development environment setup
- Develop shared code conventions and best practices
- Implement CI/CD from day one to simplify deployment
- Be prepared to drop down to raw SQL for complex database operations

## Alternatives Considered

### Frontend Alternatives

- **Angular**: Rejected due to higher learning curve and more opinionated structure
- **Vue.js**: Considered but rejected in favor of React due to team expertise
- **Svelte**: Interesting but deemed too new for our enterprise requirements

### Backend Alternatives

- **NestJS**: Strong contender but deemed more complex than needed
- **Fastify**: Considered for performance but Express won due to familiarity and ecosystem
- **Koa**: Evaluated but Express has wider adoption and support

### Database Alternatives

- **MongoDB**: Considered but relational model of PostgreSQL better fits our domain
- **MySQL**: Viable alternative but PostgreSQL offers more advanced features
- **Cloud-managed databases**: Will be considered for production deployments

## Open Questions

- Should we consider GraphQL for API in the future?
- What is our scaling strategy when user base grows significantly?
- How will we handle database migrations in production?
