      # Upload coverage report if available and build succeeded
      # Note: pnpm build does not explicitly generate coverage.
      # If coverage is critical, a separate job or modification to build script might be needed.
      # For now, assuming build is the primary gate and coverage is secondary or handled elsewhere if needed.
      # The previous CI had a separate coverage step. If needed, it can be reinstated or a dedicated test job added.
