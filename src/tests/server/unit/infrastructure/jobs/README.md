# 🧪 Background Jobs Unit Tests

## 📋 Overview

This directory contains unit tests for the background job processing infrastructure. The tests validate job scheduling, execution, persistence, and error handling capabilities.

## 🔍 Key Test Scenarios

### Job Scheduling

- Immediate job scheduling
- Delayed job scheduling
- Recurring job scheduling
- Cron-based scheduling
- Priority-based scheduling

### Job Execution

- Synchronous job execution
- Asynchronous job execution
- Worker pool management
- Job concurrency limits
- Worker distribution

### Job Persistence

- Job serialization/deserialization
- Job state persistence
- Job recovery after restart
- Failed job handling
- Job completion tracking

### Error Handling

- Job failure retry logic
- Error reporting
- Poison message handling
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Graceful degradation

## 🔧 Test Implementation Details

### Mocks and Stubs

- Mock job handlers
- Mock storage providers
- Time manipulation

### Common Patterns

```typescript
// Example pattern for testing delayed job execution
it("should execute delayed jobs after the specified delay", async () => {
  // Arrange
  const mockHandler = jest.fn();
  const jobService = new JobService();
  jest.useFakeTimers();

  // Register job handler
  jobService.registerJobHandler("test-job", mockHandler);

  // Act
  const jobId = await jobService.scheduleJob(
    "test-job",
    { data: "test" },
    {
      delay: 1000, // 1 second delay
    },
  );

  // Assert - job not executed immediately
  expect(mockHandler).not.toHaveBeenCalled();

  // Fast-forward time
  jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000);

  // Wait for job execution
  await new Promise((resolve) => setImmediate(resolve));

  // Assert - job executed after delay
  expect(mockHandler).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ data: "test" });
});
```

## 📚 Advanced Testing Techniques

### Concurrency Testing

- Multiple concurrent jobs
- Race condition handling
- Resource contention

### Durability Testing

- Process crash simulation
- Job recovery testing
- Data consistency verification

### Performance Testing

- Job throughput measurement
- Queue depth monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
