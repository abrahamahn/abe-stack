# üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

## üìã Overview

This directory contains various development tools, scripts, and utilities that support the development, building, analysis, and deployment of the application. These tools are not part of the runtime application but are essential for development workflows and infrastructure maintenance.

## üß© Directory Structure

| Directory                                     | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`code_analysis/`](./code_analysis/README.md) | Tools for static code analysis, code quality checks, and codebase metrics   |
| [`installation/`](./installation/README.md)   | Scripts for setting up development environments and installing dependencies |

## üîç Key Tools

The tools in this directory serve several important functions:

1. **Code Quality Assurance**: Scripts that analyze code quality, enforce coding standards, and detect potential issues
2. **Development Setup**: Tools for bootstrapping development environments and ensuring consistent configurations
3. **Build Process Support**: Utilities that assist in the build and bundling process
4. **Deployment Assistance**: Tools that facilitate deployment to various environments

## üîß Usage

Most tools in this directory are designed to be run from the command line. You can typically execute them as follows:

```bash
# For Python scripts
python src/tools/code_analysis/extract_server.py

# For TypeScript/JavaScript tools (via npm scripts)
npm run setup
```

Some tools may also be integrated into CI/CD pipelines or pre-commit hooks for automated execution.

## üìö Best Practices

When developing or modifying tools in this directory:

1. **Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation for each tool, including usage examples
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure tools work across different operating systems
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and provide helpful error messages
4. **Configuration**: Support external configuration when appropriate
5. **Modularity**: Keep tools focused on single responsibilities and leverage composition
